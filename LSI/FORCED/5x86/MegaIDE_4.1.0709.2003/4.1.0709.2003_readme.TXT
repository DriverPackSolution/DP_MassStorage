==========
What's New
==========
Driver Version 4.1.0709.2003
- DMA Bus Master Data Integrity -- LSI found a rare operating condition with the MegaRAID IDE 100 and MegaRAID 
  ATA 133 controllers where an interrupt to the IDE device stops a write data operation before it is complete 
  and potentially discards the data rather than writing it to system memory.  This issue was fixed by modifying
  the driver to ignore a scenario where an interrupt on the bus master status register and the DMA-Active 
  bit is also set, and postpones interrupt handling. This sequence continues until the data transfers are 
  cleared. This prevents the abort of the DMA, thus maintaining data integrity.
