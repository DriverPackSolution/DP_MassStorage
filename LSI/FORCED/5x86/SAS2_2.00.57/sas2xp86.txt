1.0 Introduction for Windows XP x86


Windows XP x86 is an operating system designed to run on Intel x86 32-bit
compatible processors using current technology. It provides a graphical
user interface environment incorporating many high-level features. Refer
to the Microsoft Windows XP x86 documentation for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows XP x86. To address a
peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows
XP x86 provides class drivers for hard disk, optical, CD-ROM, printer,
and scanner peripherals. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral
manufacturers, may be added to support new devices. Tape device support
is built into the operating system itself and does not require a class
driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the
miniport driver, which is called SAS2XP86.SYS.  This driver completes the
path to the LSI controller or processor with an optional SAS BIOS.

This miniport driver uses the Microsoft ScsiPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft StorPort driver in newer versions of Windows).  A StoprPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements
on large server systems with many storage adapters.  This miniport driver
(SAS2XP86.SYS) is NOT designed to take advantage of these enhancements for
improved performance.  This driver (SAS2XP86.SYS) is provided for SAS
Generation 2 backward compatability on Windows XP x86 systems.  If improved
performance is desired, upgrade to the LSI SAS Gen 2 StorPort driver,
LSI_SAS2.SYS which supports Windows versions other than Windows XP x86.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features 

The SAS2XP86.SYS miniport driver supports these features:

o  Supports End-to-End Data Protection (EEDP)
o  Supports 1.5Gb, 3Gb and 6Gb SAS expanders/devices and SATA devices
o  Supports PCI-Express bus protocols
o  Supports LSI Fusion-MPT common software interface 
o  Supports multiple host adapters 
o  Supports multiple Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) 
o  Supports Scatter-Gather 
o  Supports SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  Supports disk array configurations with no LUN 0 
o  Supports disk array configurations with non-contiguous LUNs 
o  Auto request sense 
o  Maximum block size support: 1 Mbyte (32-bit), 2 Mbyte (64-bit)
.........................................................................
1.2 LSI Devices Supported 

o  LSISAS2004
o  LSISAS2008
o  LSISAS2108
o  LSISAS2116

.........................................................................
1.3 Description

The SAS2XP86.SYS driver meets the Microsoft specification for miniport
drivers.  This driver allows connection of SAS devices including disk drives,
CD/DVD-ROMs, and tape drives for PCI-Express based machines. To support a
different SAS device type, the Windows XP x86 architecture requires that a
class driver for that type of device be present (usually supplied by
Microsoft, or possibly by the peripheral manufacturer). No changes to the LSI
drivers are required. The driver supports only Windows XP x86 and all
subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the SAS Protocol devices
by using the SCSI pass-through facility. This facility allows applications to
directly control and access devices by filling in a data structure and calling
into the port or class driver. Refer to the Microsoft Windows XP x86
documentation for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the SAS2XP86.SYS Driver


This procedure installs the SAS2XP86.SYS driver onto a new or existing Windows
XP x86 system. Depending upon the media used to distribute LSI drivers (web or
CD/DVD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you will create a driver diskette.

Copy the files listed in this section to the root directory of a clean
diskette as shown below.  Label this diskette "Windows XP x86 Driver
Diskette". You will use this diskette during the installation process.

        txtsetup.oem
        sas2xp86.tag
        sas2xp86.inf
        sas2xp86.sys
        lsinodrv.inf
        
For a driver upgrade the driver files can also be copied onto a hard drive,
CD or DVD, or a USB flash drive.
        
............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the SAS2XP86.SYS driver onto a Windows XP x86
system. Use this procedure when installing Windows XP x86 onto an
unused drive. Windows XP x86 automatically adds the driver to the
registry and copies the driver to the appropriate directory.

The method for installing Windows XP x86 on a new system involves using
a CD/DVD-ROM. Installation using boot floppy diskettes is not supported by
Windows XP x86.

............................................................................
2.1.1 CD/DVD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows XP x86 installation by booting from the Windows
   XP x86 CD/DVD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a CD/DVD-ROM. BIOS settings may
   need to be changed to allow CD/DVD-ROM booting.

2. Press the F6 key to install the SAS2XP86.SYS driver when the screen displays
   "Windows Setup".

   This must be done or else the new driver will not be recognized.

   Note: Be sure to press the F6 key as any driver loaded later in the
         installation process is not recognized by Windows XP x86 Setup.
         If F6 is not pressed, all devices controlled by the drivers are
         not available during Windows XP x86 setup.

3. Choose S to specify an additional device when the screen displays "Setup
   could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices...". 

   NOTE: If this screen is not displayed as the first user input, then 
         pressing the F6 key was not seen by the setup program. Reboot the 
         system and try again.

   The system prompts for the manufacturer-supplied hardware support disk.

4. Insert the appropriate driver diskette containing the Windows XP x86
   driver required to support your LSI adapter(s) and press Enter.
    
   Note: Current Windows XP x86 drivers can be downloaded from the
         LSI Corporation web site at:
             http://www.lsi.com/downloads/selectDownload.do
         After you are connected to this web site, select the product
         category, family, and the appropriate product.  Select the Driver
         checkbox and click Go.  Click on the desired Windows XP x86 driver
         to begin the download.

5. The screen will display the driver to be installed:

       "LSI Fusion-MPT SAS2 Driver (XP x86)"
       
   Press Enter to proceed.

   Return to the Windows XP x86 Setup screen.

6. Press Enter to proceed.

   The message about setup loading files appears.

7. Follow the Microsoft Windows XP x86 installation procedure at this point.

............................................................................
2.2 Existing System Installation

This procedure installs or upgrades the SAS2XP86.SYS drivers onto an existing
Windows XP x86 system.

NOTE: When a LSI SAS Gen2 adapter is added to an existing system installation,
      the new adapter is automatically detected at the next reboot. When the
      Device Driver Wizard appears at boot, click on the Next button and
      continue at step 8 below.

1. Boot Windows XP x86 and logon as a user that has Administrator
   privileges.

2. Click on the Start button, then right-click on the My Computer entry in
   the menu.

3. Click on the Properties selection.

4. Click on the Hardware tab, and then the Device Manager button.

5. Click the "+" to the left of the SCSI and RAID controllers line.  Find the
   adapter desired for the driver upgrade and double-click the entry.  Click
   on the Driver tab.

6. Information on the currently installed driver is displayed, and additional
   driver details can be viewed by clicking the "Driver Details" button.

7. Click on the "Update Driver" button to update the existing driver.  The
   Hardware Update Wizard begins.
   
8. Click on the "Install from a list or specific location..." button to select
   it, then click on the Next button.

9. Click on the "Don't search, I will choose the driver to install." button
   to select it, then click on the Next button.

10. Click on the "Have Disk" button and type the path to the driver, or click
    on the Browse button.  Click the OK button.

11. Select the driver from the list and click on the Next button.

12. Click on the Next button again to start the driver update.

    In some cases, a message will display saying that this driver has not
    passed logo testing. This message informs you that a nonsigned driver is
    being installed.

    Note: Drivers are digitally signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware
          Quality Lab (WHQL) on completion of logo testing.  Due to the time
          lag between the general customer release by LSI of Windows drivers
          and the completion of WHQL logo testing, some drivers distributed
          with adapters or downloaded from the www.lsi.com web site may not be
          digitally signed.

13. Click STOP Installation to cancel the installation if a nonsigned driver
    is not desired.

      or

    Click Continue Anyway to continue the installation.

    The system will load the driver from the Windows XP x86 driver
    diskette. A message box may display indicating that the target (existing)
    driver is newer than the source (upgrade) driver.

14. Click No to cancel the driver upgrade at this point.

      or

    Click Yes to continue the installation.

    The system copies the driver to the system disk. For any adapter other
    than the boot adapter, the updated driver will become active immediately.
    For the boot adapter, a message box displays indicating that you must
    reboot your system for the new driver to take effect.

15. Click on the Finish button to complete the driver upgrade.

2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows XP x86
Windows XP x86 has registry entries that can be used to tune the
performance of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. Please refer to Microsoft
documentation for specifics.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The SAS2XP86.SYS driver is configured by default to provide optimum
performance in most standard systems.  

However, it is possible to fine-tune certain driver parameters using a utility
provided on the OS installation disk, the Windows Driver Configuration Utility
(WDCFG).

The utility comprises 2 files which must be installed manually under Windows
XP.  The WDCFG.EXE file should be manually copied to the \windows\system32
directory on the system volume.  The DriverConfigParam.def should be manually
copied to the \ProgramData\LSI\Wdcfg directory on the system volume.  Note
that this directory path must be manually created under Windows XP, and that
it contains no space characters.

TO use the utility, first launch a Command Prompt window.  In the Command Prompt 
window, enter the "wdcfg -?" command to display full usage information.  The 
usage information explains how to query and set parameters, and how to use the
utility to display a list of driver configuration parameters which can be
controlled using the utility (including full explanations of each).

Note that parameter changes are only activated within the driver following a
driver initialization.  This may be done by restarting the machine, or by using
Device Manager to disable and re-enable the driver (Take care not to do this
to a driver servicing the boot volume).

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The SAS2XP86.SYS driver will log error messages to the system error log. For
these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11, and the specific error
code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data should be displayed in words.
