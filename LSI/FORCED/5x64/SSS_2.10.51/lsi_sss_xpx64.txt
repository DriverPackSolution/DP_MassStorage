1.0 Introduction for Windows XP x64


Windows XP x64 is an operating system designed to run on Extended-64 (x64)
(AMD64/EM64T) processors using current technology. It provides a graphical
user interface environment incorporating many high-level features. Refer to the
Microsoft Windows XP x64 documentation for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows XP x64. To address a
peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows
XP x64 provides class drivers for hard disk, optical, CD-ROM, printer,
and scanner peripherals. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral
manufacturers, may be added to support new devices. Tape device support is
built into the operating system itself and does not require a class driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the miniport
driver, which is called LSI_SSS.SYS.  This driver completes the path to the
LSI controller or processor with an optional SSS BIOS.

This miniport driver uses the Microsoft StorPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft ScsiPort driver in earlier versions of Windows).  The StorPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements on
large server systems with many storage adapters.  This miniport driver is
designed to take advantage of these enhancements for improved performance.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features 

The LSI_SSS.SYS miniport driver supports these features:

o  Supports PCI-Express bus protocols
o  Supports LSI Fusion-MPT common software interface 
o  Supports multiple host adapters 
o  Supports Scatter-Gather 
o  Supports SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  Supports LSI WarpDrive Solid State Storage
o  Auto request sense 
o  Maximum block size support: 1 Mbyte (32-bit), 2 Mbyte (64-bit)
.........................................................................
1.2 LSI Devices Supported 

o  LSISSS6200

.........................................................................
1.3 Description

The LSI_SSS.SYS driver meets the Microsoft specification for miniport
drivers.  This driver allows support for a PCI-Express to Flash Memory disk
drive for PCI-Express based machines. The driver supports only Windows XP x64
and all subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the SAS Protocol devices
by using the SCSI pass-through facility. This facility allows applications to
directly control and access devices by filling in a data structure and calling
into the port or class driver. Refer to the Microsoft Windows XP x64
documentation for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the LSI_SSS.SYS Driver


This procedure installs the LSI_SSS.SYS driver onto a new or existing Windows
XP x64 system. Depending upon the media used to distribute LSI drivers (web or
CD/DVD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you will create a driver diskette.

Copy the files listed in this section to the root directory of a clean
diskette as shown below.  Label this diskette "Windows XP x64 Driver
Diskette". You will use this diskette during the installation process.

        txtsetup.oem
        lsi_sss.tag
        lsi_sss.inf
        lsi_sss.sys
        lsinodrv.inf
        sxpam64.cat
        
For a driver upgrade the driver files can also be copied onto a hard drive,
CD or DVD, or a USB flash drive.
        
............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the LSI_SSS.SYS driver onto a Windows XP x64
system. Use this procedure when installing Windows XP x64 onto an
unused drive. Windows XP x64 automatically adds the driver to the
registry and copies the driver to the appropriate directory.

The method for installing Windows XP x64 on a new system involves using
a CD/DVD-ROM. Installation using boot floppy diskettes is not supported by
Windows XP x64.

............................................................................
2.1.1 CD/DVD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows XP x64 installation by booting from the Windows
   XP x64 CD/DVD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a CD/DVD-ROM. BIOS settings may
   need to be changed to allow CD/DVD-ROM booting.

2. Press the F6 key to install the LSI_SSS.SYS driver when the screen displays
   "Windows Setup".

   This must be done or else the new driver will not be recognized.

   Note: Be sure to press the F6 key as any driver loaded later in the
         installation process is not recognized by Windows XP x64 Setup.
         If F6 is not pressed, all devices controlled by the drivers are
         not available during Windows XP x64 setup.

3. Choose S to specify an additional device when the screen displays "Setup
   could not determine the type of one or more mass storage devices...". 

   NOTE: If this screen is not displayed as the first user input, then 
         pressing the F6 key was not seen by the setup program. Reboot the 
         system and try again.

   The system prompts for the manufacturer-supplied hardware support disk.

4. Insert the appropriate driver diskette containing the Windows XP x64
   driver required to support your LSI adapter(s) and press Enter.
    
   Note: Current Windows XP x64 drivers can be downloaded from the
         LSI Corporation web site at:
             http://www.lsi.com/downloads/selectDownload.do
         After you are connected to this web site, select the product
         category, family, and the appropriate product.  Select the Driver
         checkbox and click Go.  Click on the desired Windows XP x64 driver
         to begin the download.

5. The screen will display the driver to be installed:

       "LSI Fusion-MPT SSS Driver (XP x64)"
       
   Press Enter to proceed.

   Return to the Windows XP x64 Setup screen.

6. Press Enter to proceed.

   The message about setup loading files appears.

7. Follow the Microsoft Windows XP x64 installation procedure at this point.

............................................................................
2.2 Existing System Installation

This procedure installs or upgrades the LSI_SSS.SYS drivers onto an existing
Windows XP x64 system.

NOTE: When a LSI SAS Gen2 adapter is added to an existing system installation,
      the new adapter is automatically detected at the next reboot. When the
      Device Driver Wizard appears at boot, click on the Next button and
      continue at step 8 below.

1. Boot Windows XP x64 and logon as a user that has Administrator
   privileges.

2. Click on the Start button, then right-click on the My Computer entry in
   the menu.

3. Click on the Properties selection.

4. Click on the Hardware tab, and then the Device Manager button.

5. Click the "+" to the left of the SCSI and RAID controllers line.  Find the
   adapter desired for the driver upgrade and double-click the entry.  Click
   on the Driver tab.

6. Information on the currently installed driver is displayed, and additional
   driver details can be viewed by clicking the "Driver Details" button.

7. Click on the "Update Driver" button to update the existing driver.  The
   Hardware Update Wizard begins.
   
8. Click on the "Install from a list or specific location..." button to select
   it, then click on the Next button.

9. Click on the "Don't search, I will choose the driver to install." button
   to select it, then click on the Next button.

10. Click on the "Have Disk" button and type the path to the driver, or click
    on the Browse button.  Click the OK button.

11. Select the driver from the list and click on the Next button.

12. Click on the Next button again to start the driver update.

    In some cases, a message will display saying that this driver has not
    passed logo testing. This message informs you that a nonsigned driver is
    being installed.

    Note: Drivers are digitally signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware
          Quality Lab (WHQL) on completion of logo testing.  Due to the time
          lag between the general customer release by LSI of Windows drivers
          and the completion of WHQL logo testing, some drivers distributed
          with adapters or downloaded from the www.lsi.com web site may not be
          digitally signed.

13. Click STOP Installation to cancel the installation if a nonsigned driver
    is not desired.

      or

    Click Continue Anyway to continue the installation.

    The system will load the driver from the Windows XP x64 driver
    diskette. A message box may display indicating that the target (existing)
    driver is newer than the source (upgrade) driver.

14. Click No to cancel the driver upgrade at this point.

      or

    Click Yes to continue the installation.

    The system copies the driver to the system disk. For any adapter other
    than the boot adapter, the updated driver will become active immediately.
    For the boot adapter, a message box displays indicating that you must
    reboot your system for the new driver to take effect.

15. Click on the Finish button to complete the driver upgrade.

............................................................................
2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows XP x64

Windows XP x64 has registry entries that can be used to tune the
performance of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The registry settings of
NumberOfRequests and MaximumSGList are not used by StorPort and will have no
effect on the LSI_SSS.SYS driver.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The LSI_SSS.SYS driver is configured by default to provide optimum
performance in most standard systems.

However, it is possible to fine-tune certain driver parameters using a utility
provided on the OS installation disk, the Windows Driver Configuration Utility
(WDCFG).

The utility comprises 2 files which must be installed manually under Windows
XP.  The WDCFG.EXE file should be manually copied to the \windows\system32
directory on the system volume.  The DriverConfigParam.def should be manually
copied to the \ProgramData\LSI\Wdcfg directory on the system volume.  Note
that this directory path must be manually created under Windows XP,
and that it contains no space characters.

TO use the utility, first launch a Command Prompt window.  In the Command Prompt 
window, enter the "wdcfg -?" command to display full usage information.  The 
usage information explains how to query and set parameters, and how to use the
utility to display a list of driver configuration parameters which can be
controlled using the utility (including full explanations of each).

Note that parameter changes are only activated within the driver following a
driver initialization.  This may be done by restarting the machine, or by using
Device Manager to disable and re-enable the driver (Take care not to do this
to a driver servicing the boot volume).

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The LSI_SSS.SYS driver will log error messages to the system error log. For
these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11, and the specific error
code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data should be displayed in words.
