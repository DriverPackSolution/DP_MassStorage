==========
What's New
==========
Driver Version 4.4.0630.2006
- Added support for new ICH7R Intel IDs.

Driver Version 4.3.0316.2006
- Driver ID list updated.

Driver Version 4.2.0318.2005
- Driver ID list updated.

Driver Version 4.2.0121.2005
- Driver ID list updated.

Driver Version 4.2.0107.2005
- Driver Packaging Issue fixed.

Driver Version 4.2.1118.2004
- hibernation blue screen fix is implemented in this version.

Driver Version 4.2.1109.2004
- Added additional IDs for Intel.

Driver Version 4.2.1012.2004
- CLASS Code check added in driver for ICH6R Controllers.
- Driver was aborting a Rebuild or Check consistency operations on one SPAN of RAID10 when 
  a physical drives changes state on the other leg.

Driver Version 4.2.0929.2004
- Invalid SGLIST was build when the driver was doing the error Handling.
- Driver was programming both the drives on the channel when issuing a reset during error handling.

Driver Version 4.2.0907.2004 - Re-Release
- Missed to update the driver minor version while packaging.

Driver Version 4.2.0907.2004 
- The following Fixes are done.
1. Bump up the Minor Version number.
2. Updated some ID's.
3. RAID 10 logical dirve size change problem fixed.
4. 4 MB rounding done for inserted drive.
5. Always setting spy status change flag in Physical drive IOCTLS. 
   Protected this under IRCD version check since this should be 
   done only for IRCD verion 2x.
6. When the drive is inserted the driver should not put it blindly in to rebuilding state 
   rather it should check the mirror state and then decide in what state this drive should go in.
7. When rebuilding using hotspare drive the logic of moving the failed drive to Ready is changed.
8. Updating the water mark depending on physical drive percentage rather than on logical drive 
   percentage for rebuilding is implemented.
9. When we try to boot from single span the driver was continiously timing out 
   since the driver was touching the offline drives. Strict checks should be 
   implemented in buildIO and offline drives should be removed from the list.
10. Modified the ICH6r drive hot insertion code for drive hot removal.
11. Changed the polling time from 60 Sec to 2 Seconds.

Driver version 4.1.0817.2004[Re-Release]

Driver version  4.1.0416.2004
- IA32 E support Added
- LSI Logic string in Txtsetup.oem changed ot Intel name.


Driver version  4.1.0414.2004
- Windows driver has a algorithm for detection of drives. It fires NO_OP command to drive and 
  the reponse of the drive for this command tells us that weather the drive is present or not.
  The time taken by the seagate drives was more than the driver wad waiting for. 
  The seagate drives were taking about 150 Ms while the driver was only waiting for 1 Ms and after 
  this time has elapsed the driver will assume that the drive is not connected. No further attemps to 
  detect the drives will be made by the driver. 

Driver version  4.1.0406.2004
- Driver was not picking Fix&Report/ReportOnly Flag from enquiry. The driver was picking it up when 
  the application send the driver IOCTL_SET_RAID_OPTIONS. This IOCTL will no longer be available for
  IRCD_3x and the driver will fill up these values only from Enquiry. If the application wants to 
  set this value it will have to use set enquiry IOCTL.
- When the drive is pulled while the operating system is booting the driver was not updating IRCD.
  This is taken care in this driver.
- The Drive insertion algorithm is modified because the exisiting algorithm was failing on FSC Hance 
  rapid machine. We were detecting drive present for the drive that is removed.


Driver version  4.1.0329.2004
- Windows was freezing when Rebuilding was done with Heavy IO operations. 
  This was because of the fact that the driver was doing load balancing 
  on the channel basis and switching the drives on different channels. 
  The driver was ending up in a condition where it will keep on switching 
  to channel zero and will not actually post the command because a command 
  is actually pending on the channel zero. In this condition the driver  
  repeatedly switched to channel zero and end up in a infinite loop. The problem 
  is handled by checking for pending interrupt on the target channel before 
  switching to it. 

Driver version  4.1.0308.2004
- Intel Change request for the driver package incorporated.
- Intel IDs updated as per the latest documentation.

Driver version  4.1.0226.2004
- 48Bit LBa Fixes Implemented.
- Error Log Fixes Implemented in FastIDELogError,IOCTLEraseErrorLog,IOCTLGetErrorLog.

Driver version 4.1.0116.2004
- Added the support for the FSC SSID - 1040.
- Removed the Access to the reserved bit of CMD648/649 controllers.

Driver version 4.1.1120.2003
- Changed the SSID from 3429 to 1034. 

Driver version 4.1.1106.2003
- Implemented Drive Extended size Coersion for IRCD Verison 3.1. 

Driver version 4.1.1015.2003
- When the PIO Write command was issued using PASS_THRU interface the Drive was going in to undefined state and 
  driver was timing out the command. This problem was there because the driver was not checking the busy bit before 
  writing on the drive. The driver now checks the BUSY bit and the DRQ bit properly to ensure the proper handshake.

Driver version 4.1.1008.2003
- Rebuilding was getting aborted when heavy IOs were run and the drive is inserted. This was because of the problem that the 
  IRCD update at the start of rebuild was not getting fired. This problem is taken care in this driver release.

- 6300ESB support added.

Driver version 4.1.0912.2003
- This is the initial release for Intel ICH5R product.
