1.0 Introduction for Windows Vista  


Windows Vista is an operating system designed to run on Intel architecture
(x86, 32-bit) and Extended-64 (x64, AMD64/EM64T) processors using current
technology. It provides a graphical user interface environment incorporating
many high-level features. Refer to the Microsoft Windows Vista documentation
for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows Vista. To address a peripheral,
the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows Vista provides
class drivers for hard disk, optical, CD/DVD-ROM, printer, and scanner
peripherals. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral manufacturers, may be
added to support new devices. Tape device support is built into the operating
system itself and does not require a class driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the miniport
driver, which is called LSI_SSS.SYS.  This driver completes the path to the
LSI controller or processor with an optional SSS BIOS.

This miniport driver uses the Microsoft StorPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft ScsiPort driver in earlier versions of Windows).  The StorPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements on
large server systems with many storage adapters.  This miniport driver is
designed to take advantage of these enhancements for improved performance.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features 

The LSI_SSS.SYS miniport driver supports these features:

o  Supports PCI-Express bus protocols
o  Supports LSI Fusion-MPT common software interface 
o  Supports multiple host adapters 
o  Supports Scatter-Gather 
o  Supports SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  Supports LSI WarpDrive Solid State Storage
o  Auto request sense 
o  Maximum block size support: 1 Mbyte (32-bit), 2 Mbyte (64-bit)
.........................................................................
1.2 LSI Devices Supported 

o  LSISSS6200

.........................................................................
1.3 Description

The LSI_SSS.SYS driver meets the Microsoft specification for miniport
drivers.  This driver allows support for a PCI-Express to Flash Memory disk
drive for PCI-Express based machines.  The driver supports only Windows Vista
and all subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the parallel SCSI,
Fibre Channel or SAS Protocol devices by using the SCSI pass-through facility.
This facility allows applications to directly control and access devices by
filling in a data structure and calling into the port or class driver. Refer
to the Microsoft Windows Vista documentation for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the LSI_SSS.SYS Driver


This procedure installs the LSI_SSS.SYS driver onto a new or existing Windows
Vista system. Depending upon the media used to distribute LSI drivers (web or
CD/DVD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you will create a driver install package
on some type of accessible media.  This can be a diskette, CD or DVD, or USB
flash drive.  The driver install package can also be placed on a hard disk for
driver upgrades only.

Copy the files listed in this section to a folder on the desired media as
shown below. You will use this driver package during the installation process.

        lsi_sss.inf
        lsi_sss.sys
        lsinodrv.inf
        svlhx86.cat (for x86) or
        svlhx64.cat (for x64)
        
Note: Windows Vista drivers must be either Release signed (by LSI) or WHQL
      logo signed (by Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs) to be installed
      on Vista.  Any modifications to any of the above files will invalidate
      the digital signature of the package and Vista will not install the
      driver.

............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the LSI_SSS.SYS driver onto a Windows Vista system.
Use this procedure when installing Windows Vista onto an unused drive. Windows
Vista automatically adds the driver to the registry and copies the driver to
the driver storage area.

............................................................................
2.1.1 DVD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows Vista installation by booting from the Windows Vista
   DVD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a DVD-ROM. BIOS settings may need
   to be changed to allow DVD-ROM booting.
   
2. Process with the installation of Windows Vista. When the screen displays
   "Where do you want to install Windows?", click on the Load Driver icon.
   
3. Be sure the media with the LSI_SSS driver install package for the system
   processor architecture is inserted in the system.  Click the Browse button,
   browse to the location of the driver package, then click OK.
   
   Note: Current Windows Vista drivers can be downloaded from the LSI

2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows Vista

Windows Vista has registry entries that can be used to tune the performance of
SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The registry settings of NumberOfRequests
and MaximumSGList are not used by StorPort and will have no effect on the
LSI_SSS.SYS driver.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The LSI_SSS.SYS driver is configured by default to provide optimum
performance in most standard systems.

However, it is possible to fine-tune certain driver parameters using a utility
provided on the OS installation disk, the Windows Driver Configuration Utility
(WDCFG).

The WDCFG utility is fully installed automatically as part of the driver
installation.

To use the utility, first launch a Command Prompt window.  In the Command Prompt 
window, enter the "wdcfg -?" command to display full usage information.  The 
usage information explains how to query and set parameters, and how to use the
utility to display a list of driver configuration parameters which can be
controlled using the utility (including full explanations of each).

Note that parameter changes are only activated within the driver following a
driver initialization.  This may be done by restarting the machine, or by using
Device Manager to disable and re-enable the driver (Take care not to do this
to a driver servicing the boot volume).

............................................................................
2.4 WinPE Installation

WinPE is provided to system OEM's to create a Pre-install Environment image.
To use the LSI_SSS.SYS driver with the Windows Vista based WinPE, perform
the steps listed below.

1. Create an lsi_sss folder in the winpe_image directory under i386\system32.
   For example: mkdir winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sss
 
2. Copy the lsi_sss driver package to the winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sss
   folder.

3. Edit the winpe_image\i386\System32\Winpeoem.sif to remove the semicolons
   from the [OemDriverParams] section and add the name of the lsi_sss
   directory to the OemDriverDirs entry. For example:

   [OemDriverParams]
   OemDriverRoot = ""
   OemDriverDirs = lsi_sss
 
4. You can then use oscdimg to create a bootable .iso image, or follow the
   WinPE User’s Guide to create a bootable USB flash device.

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The LSI_SSS.SYS driver will log error messages to the system error log. For
these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11, and the specific error
code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data should be displayed in words.
