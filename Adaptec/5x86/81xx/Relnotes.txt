8. Windows REGISTRY PARAMETERS:
----------------------------------------------

8.1 Driver Specific Registry Parameters

 
WARNING: Altering or adding these driver parameters incorrectly can render your system inoperable.
Use them with caution.

Follow the instructions below to enter registry values that affect the configuration information for the AAR81xx
driver. Note that all HostRAID adapters supported by the installed driver are affected by the values you enter here.

 
The key used for this HostRAID release is "AAR81xx". To enter driver-specific parameters, follow these steps: 

1) Select Run from the Start button.

2) Type "regedt32" and press Enter.

3) Open the registry list to the following location: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AAR81xx

If the \Parameters\Device\ keys already exist, skip to step 6 to begin entering parameters. If the keys
do not yet exist, follow steps 4 and 5 to create them.

4) Click on the AAR81xx key. Select "New -> Key" from the Edit menu, type "Parameters" in the "New Key #1" 
edit box, and press Enter. 

5) Click on the Parameters key. Select the "New -> Key" from the Edit menu, type "Device" in the "New Key #1"
edit box, and press Enter. To specify a specific host adapter, append Device with the number of the host 
adapter. For example, type "Device0" for the first host adapter, "Device1" for the second, etc. If you omit the
host adapter number, the configuration information will apply to all supported host adapters.

6) Go to the Parameters\Device key. Select "New -> String Value" from the Edit menu, type "DriverParameters" in the
"New Value #1" box, and press Enter twice.
The Edit String text box appears. Enter valid parameters in the text box. Use a semicolon to separate multiple
parameters. For example:

<Parameter1>=<Value1>;<Parameter2>=<Value2>;
MaximumSGList=17;PK=1;

NOTE: Changes made with the Registry Editor do not take effect until you reboot your computer.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Option: Performance/Compatibility Settings

Definition: This registry option tunes the setting for performance purpose. This registry option 
modifies the maximum number of I/Os and maximum number of scatter gather elements or number of 
physical breaks. The setting can be set as high or normal. When set to high it modifies the 
maximum I/Os to 255 and maximum scatter gather list to 33. In this mode, system hibernation may 
not work. Use the following parameter and value to modify the driver behavior.

To run driver in high performance:
Use the registry file HIGHPERF.REG.

To run driver in normal mode:
Use the registry file WHQL.REG.

Follow these steps to change the settings:

1) Select Run from the Start button.
2) Browse to the folder containing above mentioned version of the HostRAID driver, select file 
"HIGHPERF.REG" or "WHQL.REG" and click OK.

NOTE: The default value for this parameter is normal mode and it supports system hibernation.

                    
Possible Values: Normal Mode - High Performance Mode
Default Value: Normal Mode

----------------------------------------------------------------

Option: ExposeEnclosure

Definition: This registry option changes the appearance of enclosure management devices to the 
operating system. One can directly edit the registry and apply the required changes to this
option as explained in section 5.1.

There is another way to reflect expose enclosure change using the "ENCLOSURE.REG" file
Follow these steps to change the settings:

1) Select Run from the Start button.
2) Browse to the folder containing above mentioned version of the HostRAID driver, select file 
"ENCLOSURE.REG" and click OK.

Note: If you use the second option to expose enclosure, then use the 
"Performance/Compatibility Settings" option to bring driver to Normal Mode using "WHQL.REG" file.

Possible Values: 0-1 (0=do not expose enclosure, 1=expose enclosure)
Default Value: 0

----------------------------------------------------------------

8.2 Windows Specific Registry Parameters

NOTE: This setting applies to Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.

The only Windows-specific parameter that you can currently change is the TimeOutValue. This registry 
option increases the timeout for all disk class devices (in contrast to the driver-specific registry 
parameters that affect only your HostRAID adapter).

The default TimeOutValue is 10 seconds. Follow these steps to increase this value to 60 seconds:

1) Select Run from the Start button.
2) Browse to the folder containing above mentioned version of the HostRAID driver, select the file "TIMEOUT.REG"
and click OK.

Note: Changes made with the Registry Editor do not take effect until you reboot your computer.
